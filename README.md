The analysis is intended to help businesses, policymakers, and job seekers understand and respond to the ways AI is transforming the job market.

## Key Findings

Through data visualization and storytelling, this project highlights how AI:
- Creates new opportunities in fields requiring advanced technical skills.
- Poses challenges for jobs that involve routine tasks, which are more susceptible to automation.
- Shifts demand toward hybrid skills that combine technical proficiency and creative or social capabilities.

These insights are essential for preparing the workforce with relevant skills and making informed decisions about talent development and resource allocation.

## Tools and Methodology

This project leverages:
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: To manage and query datasets for meaningful insights.
